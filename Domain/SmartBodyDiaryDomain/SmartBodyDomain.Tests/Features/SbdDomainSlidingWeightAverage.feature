Scenario: Calling calculate without weight data
	Given These weight records are available
		| Day | Weight |
	Given the sliding weight is calculated considering '7' records
	Then No weight calculation exception occurred

Scenario: Calling calculate with a single weight record
	Given These weight records are available
		| Day        | Weight |
		| 2021-06-10 | 80.8   |
	Given the sliding weight is calculated considering '7' records
	Then The sliding weight for '10.06.2021' is '80.8'

Scenario: Verify the average weight on a given day
	Given the sliding weight is calculated considering '7' records
	Then The sliding weight for '09.06.2021' is '81.30'

Scenario: Verify the average weight on a given day is correct after multiple calculation calls
	Given the sliding weight is calculated considering '7' records
	Then The sliding weight for '09.06.2021' is '81.30'
	Given the sliding weight is calculated considering '7' records
	Then The sliding weight for '09.06.2021' is '81.30'
